Project1:
Infix to postfix converter and infix calculator:

In InfixCalculator, the code reads the name of the test file and put them into a ArrayList of String.
Then I delete all the white space in the string and split them by the operator since a calculator(not parentheses) must
separates two numbers.
After that I use the shunting-yard algorithm to convert infix expression to postfix expression and evaluate the postfix
expression.
Finally I write all the result into a file.

Where exceptions are likely encountered, I use try-catch too prevent the code stop at those place and print what the
exception is. Also my code support exponential and trigonometry calculation. These two points can be consider as extra
credit.

testcase.txt is a test file created by myself that would sufficient show how my code woks well. result.txt is the
expected output. infix_expr_short.txt is the standard input on the BlackBoard, I include this file in terms of
convenience.
