Project1:
Infix to postfix converter and infix calculator:

In InfixCalculator, the code reads the name of the test file and put them into a ArrayList of String.
Then I delete all the white space in the string and split them by the operator since a calculator(not parentheses) must
separates two numbers.
After that I use the shunting-yard algorithm to convert infix expression to postfix expression and evaluate the postfix
expression.
Finally I write all the result into a file.

Where exceptions are likely encountered, I use try-catch too prevent the code stop at those place and print what the
exception is. Also my code support exponential and trigonometry calculation.
